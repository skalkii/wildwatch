"""FastAPI webhook receiver: accept VideoDB alert callbacks, fan to Telegram.

VideoDB POSTs to a public URL we register via ``index.create_alert(
callback_url=...)``. We mount one path per tier so the same handler can
route by URL segment (cheaper than parsing payload + looking up tier).

Run locally:
    uvicorn wildwatch.webhooks:app --reload --port 8000

Expose to VideoDB:
    cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
